- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components.
- Prefer `const` over `let` for variable declarations to ensure immutability.
- Use descriptive variable names with camelCase (e.g., `userProfile` instead of `up`).
- Follow the Airbnb TypeScript style guide for consistency.
- Use Next.js server components where appropriate to optimize performance.
- Ensure all components and functions have explicit TypeScript types (e.g., `interface Props`).
- Integrate with Supabase using its TypeScript client library for authentication and database operations.
- Prefer Next.js API routes for server-side logic over external endpoints when possible.
