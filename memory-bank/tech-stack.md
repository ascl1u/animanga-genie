# Tech Stack: AI-Powered Anime Recommendation Engine:

### Frontend

- **Next.js**
  - **Purpose**: A React framework for building the user interface and handling server-side rendering (SSR).
  - **Why**: Offers excellent performance, SEO support, and built-in API routes for backend integration. Ideal for dynamic content like recommendations.
- **shadcn/ui**
  - **Purpose**: A component library for styling and UI development.
  - **Why**: Speeds up frontend development with reusable, responsive components and a consistent design system.

### Backend

- **Supabase**
  - **Purpose**: Backend-as-a-service providing a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real-time features.
  - **Why**: Simplifies database management and user authentication, integrates seamlessly with Next.js, and supports relational data like anime metadata and user profiles.

### AI/ML

- **Python**
  - **Purpose**: Core language for building the recommendation engine.
  - **Why**: Industry standard for machine learning with extensive libraries and community support.
- **PyTorch**
  - **Purpose**: Frameworks for developing and training recommendation models.
  - **Why**: Robust tools for implementing collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and NLP tasks.
- **Deployment**
  - **Purpose**: Running the ML model independently.
  - **Why**: Deployed as a separate service or via serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda) to handle resource-intensive tasks without overloading the Next.js app.

### Integration

- **Next.js API Routes**
  - **Purpose**: Connects the frontend to the recommendation engine and Supabase.
  - **Why**: Keeps the architecture simple by handling requests within the same framework.

### Hosting

- **Vercel**
  - **Purpose**: Deploys the Next.js application.
  - **Why**: Optimized for Next.js, offering easy deployment, scaling, and domain management.
- **AWS or Google Cloud (Optional)**
  - **Purpose**: Hosts the ML service if deployed separately.
  - **Why**: Provides flexibility for compute-heavy tasks like model inference.

## Why Next.js + Supabase?

- **Next.js**: Combines frontend and backend capabilities, reducing complexity and speeding up development. Its SSR and static generation features suit a recommendation platform.
- **Supabase**: Offers a scalable database and authentication out of the box, perfect for managing user data and anime metadata without heavy backend setup.
- **Complementary Additions**: Python for AI/ML ensures robust recommendations, while Chakra UI and Vercel streamline the UI and deployment process.

This stack balances ease of use, performance, and scalability, making it ideal for your project.
